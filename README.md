# Video-to-frames
Basic requirements for video analytics -- frame separation, frame rate, frame resize, Average of the frames

Images, for representing the frame data, a numerical matrix whose values can be colors, color
map entries, etc. A shot object is a discrete sequence of images with a set of temporal attributes such as frame rate and duration
and represents a video segment. A shot sequence object groups several shots using some semantic criteria.
Views, are used to visualize and browse shots and shot sequences.

Frame rate is the amount of individual video frames that your camera captures, per second. Frame rate comes in a few different standards (expressed as frames per second or fps): 24fps, 25fps, 30fps, 60fps, and 120fps. Frame rate stems from film and the very first silent films. Any frame rate at 60fps or above is considered a high speed frame rate. For example, 60fps, 120fps, and 240fps would all be considered high speed and are typically used for slow motion video. Some cameras can even go as fast as 1,000 frames per second.“Fps” stands for “frames per second.”
